# JavaProjects
A little part of the projects I coded in my first year at Imperial using Java.
Java is the second language I studied at Imperial, after Haskell.
The topics covered in the uploaded files vary a lot: from frunctional programming (javafunctionalprogramming.zip)
to working with class inheritance, interfaces and generalisation (javadiscreteeventsimulation.zip), from concurrency to complex structures.
Throughout the 4 months I studied Java at Imperial, I have spent at least 3 hours daily working not only on efficient and correct code,
but also on the Google Java Style, how to best use all the aspects of an OO language, such as generalisation and inheritance and proper immutability.
